Peter Thiel’s View
Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit. The opposite of perfect competition is monopoly. Whereas a competitive firm must sell at the market price, a monopoly owns its market, so it can set its own prices. Since it has no competition, it produces at the quantity and price combination that maximizes its profits. 
…by “monopoly,” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that went from 0 to 1: it hasn’t competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced itself from Microsoft and Yahoo! 
Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: proprietary technology, network effects, economies of scale, and branding.
As a good rule of thumb, proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell, especially in an already crowded market. The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. 
Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is.

Develop a Good Problem Statement
Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon: 
“Solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent.”
10

Getting a crystal‐clear definition of the problem you are solving is the critical starting point to bulletproof problem solving. You need to be clear about the boundaries of the problem, the criteria for success, the time frame, or level of accuracy required.
Good problem statements have a number of characteristics. They are: 
Outcomes focused: A clear statement of the problem to be solved, expressed in outcomes, not activities or intermediate outputs. 
Specific and measurable wherever possible. 
Clearly time‐bound. Designed to explicitly address decision‐maker values and boundaries, including the accuracy needed and the scale of aspirations. 
Structured to allow sufficient scope for creativity and unexpected results—too narrowly scoped problems can artificially constrain solutions. 
Solved at the highest level possible, meaning for the organization as a whole, not just optimized for a part or a partial solution.

Usher’s Model
For purposes of generalized exposition, innovation can be formalized as a genetic sequence of four steps:
Perception of a problem, an unfilled want whose gratification is made possible by the presence of some fortuitous conditions
Setting of the stage, which serves as the basis for providing mediated contingencies that engender systematic efforts to find solutions to perceived problems through trial and error
Act of insight, by which the essential solution of the problem is found
The critical revision, where the solution is studied critically and understood in its fullness

Three Approaches for Solving Problems
Brute Force
Grid search of every potential solution until one works
Example: Thomas Edison trying thousands of materials to determine the best filament for the lightbulb
Targeted Development
Theory informs potential solutions
Example: Li-ion batteries developed with heavy guidance from research in electrochemical theory
Eureka Moment
Solution results from a chance event (randomness)
Example: MOSFETs developed after accidentally discovering that current in a semiconductor can be controlled with electric field (rather than current, as in traditional bipolar junction transistors (BJTs))

How do you address a reverse salient – Abbie’s model.  For Eureka moments, there must be a trigger, a random event.  The question is whether that process can be made more efficient and speeded up; perhaps by using contemporary computing tools.  Could this also be used to predict the direction of technological advance.

Defining MECE
MECE is a list.  It is a list of qualities lists should have.  [MECE] says that when data from a category is desired to be broken into subcategories, the choice of subcategories should be
collectively exhaustive — i.e., the set of all subcategories, taken together, should fully characterize the larger category of which the data are part (“no gaps”)
mutually exclusive — i.e., no subcategory should represent any other subcategory (“no overlaps”)
This is desirable for the purpose of analysis: mutual exclusivity avoids the risk of double counting information, and collective exhaustion avoids the risk of overlooking information. 
In plain English, MECE says that a list should have
No overlaps
No gaps
Confidential for classroom use only
20
One way to think about MECE is to create a grid – the question is what goes on the x and y axes, e.g. mechanisms and methods.  Think about your reason why analysis and the associated M’s, P’s, S’s, etc.
20

Issue Trees and Logic Trees
Two areas for MECE thinking are in 
logic trees and 
issue trees.

Logic trees help you identify components of a problem. Start at the 20,000 foot view and move progressively downward. You may want to build multiple trees, for instance by business unit (organizational hierarchy) and functionally (production, sales, marketing, etc.) to see which leads you to the next step, the hypothesis.
Issue trees let you rigorously test the hypothesis. They are different from logic trees. Logic trees are a hierarchical grouping of elements. Issue trees are the series of questions or issues that must be addressed to support or disprove a hypothesis. It becomes your roadmap for analysis.

Summary: Doing MECE
Break a problem down into smaller pieces that can serve as hypotheses to be tested
Small pieces cannot overlap
Sum of small parts must equal the big group
Small elements must parallel each other, i.e. they must be in the same class or category

The Pareto Principle
The Pareto Principle (also known as the “80/20 Rule” or the “Law of the Vital Few”) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. It results from a ‘power law’ distribution.  Examples of this principle: 
Wealth: The top 20% of the population own more than 80% of the nation's wealth.
Science: The top 20% of published papers account for more than 80% of all cited works in subsequent publications.
Computing: Fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs eliminates 80% of errors and crashes in a given system.
Entertainment: The top 20% of titles make up more than 80% of viewers/listeners.

Example: Solving the Problem of Medication Errors
A medication error is a failure in the treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient. 
Per the NIH, recent studies of medical errors have estimated errors may account for as many as 251,000 deaths annually in the United States, making medical errors the third leading cause of death. 
Error rates are significantly higher in the U.S. than in other developed countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and the United Kingdom. At the same time less than 10 percent of medical errors are reported.

Example: Medication Errors
Per the WHO, there is no consensus about the definition of a medication error. A systematic literature review found 26 different terminologies employed for a medication error.
Medication errors can occur in 
deciding which medicine and dosage regimen to use (prescribing faults—irrational, inappropriate, and ineffective prescribing, under-prescribing, over-prescribing); 
writing the prescription (prescription errors); manufacturing the formulation (wrong strength, contaminants or adulterants, wrong or misleading packaging); 
dispensing the formulation (wrong drug, wrong formulation, wrong label); 
administering or taking the medicine (wrong dose, wrong route, wrong frequency, wrong duration); monitoring therapy (failing to alter therapy when required, erroneous alteration). 
They can be classified, using a psychological classification of errors, as knowledge-, rule-, action- and memory-based errors. 
Although medication errors can occasionally be serious, they are not commonly so and are often trivial. However, it is important to detect them, since system failures that result in minor errors can later lead to serious errors.

Determine a Value Proposition
A business or marketing statement that summarizes why a consumer should buy a product or use a service. 
This statement should convince a potential consumer that one particular product or service will add more value or better solve a problem than other similar offerings. 
Companies use this statement to target customers who will benefit most from using the company's products, and this helps maintain an economic moat.  
The ideal value proposition is concise and appeals to the customer's strongest decision-making drivers.

Buying the Right to Continue
Per Vijay Jolly:
Technology commercialization is a sequence of distinct subprocesses
Subprocesses are connected by bridges associated with mobilizing stakeholders
Bridging the subprocesses is about managing two things:
Creating enough value in a predecessor stage to make a technology worth taking further
Mobilizing stakeholders concerned with the next stage and convincing them of its future potential
Therefore, there is a need to satisfy the stakeholders of the technology at each stage, without whom the technology’s value does not get recognized, nor is there an impulse to take it further
Fundamentally bridging subprocesses is an exercise in stakeholder management
The accomplishment of one stage successfully reduces the total uncertainty remaining, but does not necessarily increase the probability of accomplishing a subsequent stage

Value Build-Up and Uncertainty
Bridging the subprocesses is about managing two things:
Creating enough value in a predecessor stage to make a technology worth taking further
Mobilizing stakeholders concerned with the next stage and convincing them of its future potential
The subprocesses all represent segments of the innovation process, each requiring input from a variety of functions and external sources as well as different types of research
Each segment represent as independent subprocess of value creation
Each subprocess needs to contend with its own set of stakeholders
The subprocesses conform approximately to the nature of competition and specialization in technological innovation today
The subprocesses offer a way to think about entry, exit, and alliances when it comes to bringing new technologies to market
Investments made in a technology need to match the value it creates at a point in time – either in the form of what someone is willing to pay to buy an option on it, or, if a public company, the market capitalization investors assign
Performing the various activities involved at each stage in a proficient manner enables an inventor to “buy the right to keep going by having successes along the way”

The Methodology
"When you’re stuck with a tough decision or a problem you don’t understand, talk to all the smart people you know." It’s the networking approach to problem solving….we have a well-developed and continuously refined methodology; 
Understand the market, the client, the technology, and the perceived constraints on the problem. Later in a project, we often challenge those constraints, but it’s important to understand current perceptions. 
Observe real people in real-life situations to find out what makes them tick: what confuses them, what they like, what they hate, where they have latent needs not addressed by current products and services
Visualize new-to-the-world concepts and the customers who will use them. Some people think of this step as predicting the future, and it is probably the most brainstorming-intensive phase of the process. Quite often, the visualization takes the form of a computer-based rendering or simulation, though IDEO also builds thousands of physical models and prototypes every year. For new product categories we sometimes visualize the customer experience by using composite characters and storyboard-illustrated scenarios. In some cases, we even make a video that portrays life with the future product before it really exists. 
Evaluate and refine the prototypes in a series of quick iterations. We try not to get too attached to the first few prototypes, because we know they’ll change. No idea is so good that it can’t be improved upon, and we plan on a series of improvements. We get input from our internal team, from the client team, from knowledgeable people not directly involved with the project, and from people who make up the target market. We watch for what works and what doesn’t, what confuses people, what they seem to like, and we incrementally improve the product in the next round. 
Implement the new concept for commercialization. This phase is often the longest and most technically challenging in the development process, but I believe that IDEO’s ability to successfully implement lends credibility to all the creative work that goes before.

Seven Secrets for Better Brainstorming
SHARPEN THE FOCUS  Good brainstormers start with a well-honed statement of the problem…. Go for something tangible that participants can sink their teeth into, without limiting the possible solutions. We’ve also found that the best topic statements focus outward on a specific customer need or service enhancement rather than focusing inward on some organizational goal. 
PLAYFUL RULES  Don’t start to critique or debate ideas. 
NUMBER YOUR IDEAS  We’ve found that a hundred ideas per hour usually indicates a good, fluid brainstorming session. 
BUILD AND JUMP  Try building on an idea. Encourage another push or introduce a small variation. Or take a jump, either back to an earlier path you skipped by too quickly or forward to a completely new approach. Whatever you do, try to get into the next power curve and keep the energy up,
THE SPACE REMEMBERS  Great brainstorm leaders understand the power of spatial memory. Write the flow of ideas down in a medium visible to the whole group. 
STRETCH YOUR MENTAL MUSCLES  One type of warm-up we practice is a fast-paced word game simply to clear the mind…. Another warm-up is to do some content-related homework. 
GET PHYSICAL  Good brainstorms are extremely visual. They include sketching, mind mapping, diagrams, and stick figures.

SYSTEMATIC INVENTIVE THINKING
DREW BOYD AND JACOB GOLDENBERG
THINKING INSIDE THE BOX
(SIMON & SCHUSTER: 2013)


Thinking Inside the Box
The traditional view of creativity is that it is unstructured and doesn’t follow rules or patterns. That you need to think “outside the box” to be truly original and innovative. That you should start with a problem and then “brainstorm” ideas without restraint until you find a solution. That you should “go wild” making analogies to things that have nothing to do with your products, services, or processes. That straying as far afield as possible will help you come up with a breakthrough idea. We believe just the opposite. 
We’ll show you that more innovation— and better and quicker innovation— happens when you work inside your familiar world (yes, inside the box) using what we call templates. …the majority of new, inventive, and successful products result from only five templates: 
subtraction,

The Five Templates
SUBTRACTION.  Innovative products and services often have had something removed, usually something that was previously thought to be essential to the product or service. 
DIVISION.  Many creative products and services have had a component divided out of them and placed somewhere else in the usage situation, usually in a way that initially seemed unproductive or unworkable. 
MULTIPLICATION.  With this technique, a component has been copied but changed in some way, usually in a way that initially seemed unnecessary or odd. 
TASK UNIFICATION.  With some creative products and services, certain tasks have been brought together and unified within one component of the product or service— usually a component that was previously thought to be unrelated to that task. 
ATTRIBUTE DEPENDENCY.  In many innovative products and services, two or more attributes that previously seemed unrelated now correlate with one another. As one thing changes, something else changes.

Two Key Principles
Using the Five Templates correctly relies on two key principles. 
The first is called the “Closed World” principle. We’ve actually introduced it to you already: the notion that the best and fastest way to innovate is to look at resources close at hand. 
The second principle requires retraining how your brain thinks about problem solving. Most people assume that the way to innovate is to start with a well-defined problem and then try to think of solutions. In our method, it is just the opposite. We start with an abstract, conceptual solution and then work back to the problem that it solves. Therefore, we have to learn how to reverse the usual way our brain works when innovating.

The Closed World
We believe that you’ll be most creative when you focus on the internal aspects of a situation or problem— and when you constrain your options rather than broaden them. 
By defining and then closing the boundaries of a particular creative challenge and then looking only inside these boundaries, you can be more creative more consistently than by musing about the stratosphere or, worse, waiting for the muse to descend. 
The Closed World is based on the idea that you look inward rather than outward, and that this propels you toward the virgin territory of truly creative ideas— ideas that are both original and useful. …these ideas all satisfied two conditions: 
First, they contradicted some essential belief in the prevailing wisdom about the right way to do things. 
Second, all the solutions were contained in a relatively small space surrounding the problem. …the Closed World of the problem.

The Closed World and Creativity
…our Closed World principle says that the further you go from the problem, the less creative you will be. 
Which brings us to another important point: the purpose of the Closed World is to teach creativity first and foremost. It’s not to always come up with the best solution to a problem at hand. Sometimes the best solution to a problem can actually be found outside the box. But if your goal is to systematize creativity, you have to operate within the confines of the Closed World. That is key. 
…by limiting the number of variables under consideration from infinity to a finite number, we amplify our potential to come up with a creative solution. Why? Such limits boost the creative process, allowing individuals to be more focused. 
Perhaps when people eliminate resources and pare down their problem world to its basic elements, they tap into their own natural resourcefulness. 
Creativity is really about an intelligent search among a limited list of possibilities, rather than random, long-distance outward leaps and bounds. This, then, is our first rule: look inside!
